# Full Stack Application Development Capstone Project

[Full Stack Application Development Capstone Project
](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-cloud-native-full-stack-development-capstone/home/info)

## Project requirement
A national car dealership with local branches spread across the United States recently conducted a market survey. One of the suggestions that emerged from the survey was that customers would find it beneficial if they could access a central database of dealership reviews across the country.

You are a new hire at the company. You are assigned the task of building a website that allows new and existing customers to look up different branches by state and look at customer reviews of the various branches. Customers should be able to create an account and add their review for any of the branches. The management hopes this will bring transparency to the system and also increase the trust customers have in the dealership.

After thorough research and brainstorming, the team developed use cases for anonymous, authorized, and admin users.

### Use cases for anonymous users:
- View the Contact Us page.
- View the About Us page.
- View the list of dealerships.
- Filter the list of dealerships by state:
    - Select Show all or a specific state from the State dropdown on the dealership page.
    - View all states if nothing is selected in the dropdown.
    - View a table of dealerships for the selected state when the form is submitted.
- Click on a dealership to view the reviews for that dealership on the details page with each review displayed on a bootstrap card.
- Log in using their credentials.

### Use cases for authorized users:
In addition to the above, authorized users should be able to write a review for any dealership on the dealership's page. In order to enable authorized users to write their reviews:

- A Review button should be provided against each dealer listed in the dealership table.
- Clicking on the Review button should take the user to the review page.
- Filling the form on the review page and submitting it should add the review.
```python  
{
  "user_id": 1, => from Django
  "name": "Berkly Shepley", => from Django
  "dealership": 15, => from the form
  "review": "Total grid-enabled service-desk", => form textbox
  "time": "", => current time
  "purchase": true, => form checkbox
  "purchase_date": "07/11/2020", => form calendar (bootstrap)
  "car_make": "Audi", => from django dropdown
  "car_model": "A6", => from django dropdown
  "car_year": 2010 => form django dropdown
  }
```
On submission, the user should be taken back to the dealership detail page with the submitted review featured at the top of the reviews list, sorted on time.


### Use cases for admin users:
-  Log in to the admin site with a predefined username and password.
- Add new make, model, and other attributes.
  Your organization has assigned you as the Lead Full-Stack Software Developer on this project. Your job is to develop this portal as part of your Capstone project by following best practices for Full-Stack software development.
## Course resource
7 modules

# Module 1: Create static page About us, Contact us
The Django app will be mainly used for user management and authentication, managing car models and makes, and routing other MongoDB services for dealership and customer reviews. You will build this Django app and related services in a phased manner along the capstone course.

In this module, you are asked to perform the following tasks:

- Fork the GitHub repo containing the project template.
- Clone your forked repository.
- Run the Django app on the development server.
- Add a navigation to the website using Bootstrap.
- Add an "About Us" static page.
- Add a "Contact Us" static page.
  Follow the instructional Skill Network lab to complete the above tasks step by step.

## Step 1: Clone and ckeck the main app running
As part of the project, your first task is to run and test its main Django application. You are given a skeleton of the Django application as a starting point.

### Fork and Clone the repository
- Navigate to this [repo](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/xrwvm-fullstack_developer_capstone): link and create a fork of the repository that includes essential starter code required for this project.

- Go to your forked repository.

- Copy the git clone URL of the skeleton repository that you forked into your account.
- Follow [instructions "Add static page"](./lectures/Module1_add_static_pages.pdf)
### Working with light-weight, serverless db: sqlite3

```sql
sqlite3 db.sqlite3 # connect to db
.table # list all tables
.exit # quit 
```
### Run the Django app on development server

# Module 2: User Management Overview
Now, you have the initial Django application built and deployed. In the next step, the admins of the dealership will review the app to identify users and manage their accesses based on rolesâ€¯(such as anonymous users or registered users). To accomplish this, you need to add authentication and authorization, that is, user management, to the app. In this lesson, you need to perform the following tasks to add the user management feature:

- Create a superuser for your app [Admin login](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)
- Build the Client side and configure it.
- Check the Client configuration.
- Add a Login view to handle login requests.
- Add a Logout view to handle logout requests.
- Add a Registration view to handle Sign-up requests.

- Follow the [instructional lab](./lectures/) to complete the above tasks step by step.
### Requirement to run npm command
#### Install Node16 using nvm:
- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Install node 16 that is compatible with Mac 11.3.1
- Create a simple [node web server](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/synopsis.html#example)
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
zsh: source ~/.zshrc # refress zsh file
nvm --version # check if nvm is installed
nvm ls-remote # fetch the list all node versions
nvm install <version-of-node-in-the-list>
node --version # check installed version
npm --version
nvm ls # give info of installed version on local
nvm use <version-want-to-use> # switch between different node versions

# create any folder to store your .js server
mkdir nodeDemo
cd nodeDemo
touch hello.js
ls
code hello.js # open .js in VS code 
# insert code 

const http = require('node:http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
res.statusCode = 200;
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});

###########################
node hello.js # to run server
```
#### Install Node: this way does not work for Mac 11.3.1.
```
brew install node
which npm # Example output: /usr/local/bin/npm
export PATH=$PATH:<node's bin path>
# e.g: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
source ~/.bashrc
npm -v # check if the setting path is working
```

### Users
Some users are available. You can use some [free temporary email](https://10minutemail.com/)
- admin/admin

# How to build and run Node and Django
1. If there is change in FE --> build it again
2. If there is change in model, Db --> migrate them
2. Then run Django app
```
cd <frontend folder where there is package.json>
npm run build
cd <project Djang folder where there is manage.py>
python3 manage.py check

python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate

python3 manage.py runserver
```
